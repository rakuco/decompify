decompify
  An MS-DOS COM files disassembler for Linux.
=============================================

Introduction
------------
  This project comes from an Assembly Languages and Computer Organization class
  assignment from State University of Campinas, Brazil.

  The code is licensed under the General Public License (GPL) and should be used
  by other students who want to learn Assembly.

  It's written for NASM and should compile under any Linux 2.6.x kernel.

Instruction set
---------------
  decompify follows the university assignment and only implements the Intel 186
  instruction set (not even 386 instructions are implemented).

  The instructions which are implemented can be found in assignment/proj02.pdf.

Invalid bytes
-------------
  In case decompify finds an erroneus byte in the code, it just writes a

    db BYTE

  in the code.

Jumps and labels
----------------
  Currently, jumps and branches do not generate labels. The code generated inserts
  the literal address of the jump after the mnemonic.
